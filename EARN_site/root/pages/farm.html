                        The concept of The Farm is to have a piece of land in close proximity to The Bridge, where food can be grown to feed
                        the participants as well as provide job opportunities, vocational instruction, and income from food sales. This will 
                        be the primary location for a full-scale commercial vermicomposting and Black Soldier Fly business as well as a hub 
                        for other businesses that will be launched. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Master Vermiculture technicians will be involved full-time at the facility and will provide ongoing training to 
                        participants who want to learn the trade and potentially start a franchise operation. The vermicompost 
                        produced will be used extensively at The Farm.

                        The Farm will also be a place for individuals who are coming out of prison and want to develop farming 
                        skills and/or establish and test out business models. There will be regular workshops on topics such as:

                        Although the primary purpose of The Farm is to provide food for the participants and develop agricultural
                        skills, it would have numerous other benefits such as creating opportunities for cooperatives and other 
                        collaborations. Additionally, The Farm would create the ability for individuals to learn sustainable skills 
                        and be able to improve their quality of life through the production of healthy and whole foods.

                    <p>
                        The Farm could also be used for other purposes within the broader collaboration such as vegetable garden 
                        training for low income families, etc.
                        <br>
                        Ideally, The Farm would be 5-20 acres that could be purchased or leased and would have the following:

                        Depending on the size of the property, there might also be space to have several tiny homes to provide 
                        short-term housing for participants who want to pursue agricultural endeavors.
