                    <p>
                        The concept of The Bridge is as a business incubator and accelerator for formerly incarcerated people wishing to 
                        build a business in the environmental field, to include providing tools for executing business plans, short-term 
                        housing, transportation and community work spaces. In short, The Bridge will be a facility where previously 
                        incarcerated individuals can live, work, and prepare for successful reintegration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Master Vermiculture technicians will be involved full-time at the facility and will provide ongoing training to 
                        participants who want to learn the trade and potentially start a franchise operation. The vermicompost 
                        produced will be used extensively at The Farm. The Bridge will have the following components:

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Housing</span> - several apartments, tiny homes, or other temporary housing 
                            opportunities will be created to provide short-term housing for participants at little or no cost for up 
                            to 18 months.
                        </li>

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Sustainable Business Incubator bays</span> - there will be several bays set up 
                            to allow individuals who desire to start their own business access to a space for a pre-determined 
                            period of time so that they can get their businesses off the ground.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Common Workshops</span> - many businesses need to be able to build out items or 
                            manufacture prototypes to get established. The idea behind common workshops is to have them well stocked 
                            with tools that can be used on-site to get projects started. This allows progress to take place without 
                            each individual needing to make a huge investment in tools prior to generating income.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Common office space</span> - this will be an area that has computer and internet 
                            access, copying facilities, etc. where participants can do the paperwork and research for their business 
                            plans. Having an office resource center where all participants have access creates a situation where items only 
                            have to be purchased once.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Mentorship</span> - participants will have access to experts in various fields for 
                            advice and mentoring as well as other members of the EARN network.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Common greeting/rec area</span> - this will be used as a common gathering area as 
                            well as for scheduled group meetings such as HEAL, AA, NA, etc.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Common kitchen area</span> - this will be a space where communal meals can be 
                            prepared as well as be used for potential cottage industries such as making pies, canning jams etc.. Items can 
                            then be taken to local farmers' markets or sold to subscribers.

                            <span class="bridgeItems">Automotive shop</span> - this will be a space where individuals who have automotive 
                            experience can work on vehicles and get them ready for use by participants. This has the potential for being 
                            a tremendous resource for individuals coming out of prison as well as other non-profits that are part of this 
                            collaboration as the need for inexpensive, dependable transportation for staff and stakeholders is great.

                        The optimum facility for The Bridge would be an old factory or industrial center that is no longer in use with 
                        multiple bays and a large parking lot. An old grocery store, school, mill, etc. would work as well. It would be 
                        best if located somewhat off of the beaten path. We are ideally looking for something in the range of 50,000 
                        square feet of space. The idea is that there would be 15-20 people using this facility at any given time with 
                        very specific timeframes and agreements on how the different aspects of the facility would be used.
