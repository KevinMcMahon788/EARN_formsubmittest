                    <p>Hello all!</p>
                    <p> Sorry it has been a moment since you have heard from us. It has been a bit of a chaotic summer. It seems there are three 
                        things driving dysfunction at the prison these days; covid, heatwaves and a lack of staffing. I am a firm believer that the 
                        covid pandemic fundamentally changed a very broken system. It very well may be that we are in the death throes of the punitive 
                        model. That will hopefully someday be a good thing but as we all know, old habits die hard. In the meantime we are serving 
                        some of the toughest years we have experienced. As I write this we are in yet another covid lockdown quarantine. Prisoners 
                        who test positive go to IMU for a ten day isolation period. The rest of us sit in our cells with no programming and wait to 
                        see if we have tested positive. Tomas and I wrote a piece about this in Filter this summer and it is weird to 
                        see it play out again. (A Pandemic of Anxiety at https://filtermag.org/pandemic-anxiety-prison/)
                    </p>
                    <p>Luckily we have our little community and we are finding ways to support each other. In positive news, we have 
                        spent a lot of time in conversations with Art and have taken significant steps to create Singing Heart Forest 
                        Therapy Retreat Center. Our goal is to eventually have a series of cabins and yurts at the ranch that can be 
                        used for forest therapy retreats for system impacted people. We will have much more on this as it develops.
                    </p>
                    <p>The coolest news is that our website is now up and running!! Huge props to Kev for making that a reality.
                    </p>

                    <p id="perserverance">
                        In reading through the previous newsletters it is appalling at how many start off with us being in a Covid 
                        lockdown. We are rapidly approaching 3 years of this and it is taxing to say the least. The best we can say 
                        about it is we are building our endurance and figuring out ways to make our systems "pandemic proof" as much 
                        as possible.
                    </p> 
                    <h3 class="points-each">Point of Practice:</h3>
                    <p id="practice">
                        We have really been working to dial in the Black Solider Fly management systems. It can appear to be labor 
                        intensive at times and in order to make it truly sustainable we need to figure out more of a perpetual motion 
                        process. We have had a massive surplus of grubs this summer and the chickens are absolutely crazy for them. 
                        At one point we were feeding them so much that they started refusing their regular feed. Spoiled little 
                        monsters.:-) :-)
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="points-each">Point of Peace:</h3>
                    <p id="peace">
                        September was Juan's birthday and we had a series of feasts. I made a cake that a bunch of us chipped in on 
                        and it was mammoth! It weighed over 35 pounds. It was so fun to cut off big slices and pass them out. 
                        It reminded us of the sense of community we hope to have at EARN and how someday we will be able to get 
                        together with all of you.

                            We spent the majority of the summer working on projects and pushing a proposal through the incredibly 
                            difficult layers of DOC bureaucracy, that would create a training center here at WCC for prisoners to 
                            learn food waste mangement techniques. Namely, black soldier flies, vermicomposting and Bokashi. The WA 
                            legislature passed a landmark bill last year essentially mandating that all businesses and public entities 
                            that produce food waste find alternative ways of dealing with it using one of the following methods: 
                            conventional composting, anaerobic compositing, vermicomposting or black soldier flies!!!!
                        </P>
                        <P class="body-text">
                            We were blown away when we saw the very technologies we have been working on for over a decade in the law! 
                            What this means is that there is going to be funding and energy around the very areas we have made 
                            ourselves experts at. We prepared a proposal on it and are hoping to foster a relationship between SPP 
                            and Correctional Industries to create something very special. It is always hard getting something new 
                            started and especially in this climate but we are hopeful.
                        </P>

                            The folks at the Sustainability in Prisons Project (SPP) have been incredibly important to us through 
                            this journey and we believe they will be essential partners down the road. What you may not know is all 
                            the different projects that they are involved in. We spend a lot of time talking compositing programs but 
                            that is just one area they support. They have dog programs, beekeeping, and multiple conservation programs 
                            that have prisoners working with the Dept. of Wildlife to raise endangered species and the Dept. 
                            Agriculture to raise key prairie plants and grasses just to name a few. They teach a wide variety of 
                            classes and develop curriculum that can be used in carceral settings. It would take several newsletters 
                            to outline everything SPP does (you can check it all out at www.sustainabilityinprisonsproject.org) but 
                            suffice it so say they have made an idellible impact on the prison system and have been a champion for 
                            starting these types of programs around the nation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-text">
                            Our goal is to work with them once EARN is fully up and running, to create numerous career paths for 
                            prisoners who have found their "calling" in environmental work.

                    <p class="thoughts">
                        These past few years have been difficult and prison has really deteriorated to a place where people are 
                        struggling with mental health and fatigue issues. But this only reinforces our commitment to build EARN as the 
                        need for restorative services and support is greater than ever. Thank you so much for being our community out 
                        there and supporting us!
