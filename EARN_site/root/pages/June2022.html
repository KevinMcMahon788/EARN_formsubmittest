                <h2 id="update-header">Update:</h2>
                <p id="update">
                    Well, I guess I spoke too soon in our last newsletter because soon after it went out our unit went back on Covid 
                    quarantine. Uugghh!!!! It is starting to feel like a never-ending saga. The worst part of Covid inside prison is that it has reduced 
                    prison to just slightly better than county jail time. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is basically 
                    a lot of sitting around and waiting. Tomas and I (Nick) just recently wrote an article called "A Pandemic of 
                    Anxiety" that discusses the mental health toll of constantly having this pandemic hanging over your head. It 
                    hasn't published yet but we will share it when it is.
                    As usual, Juan and I shifted gears and tried to make this lockdown productive. Juan has been working through some books 
                    and activities on mentoring and he has been putting it into practice. There is a young man who was in his construction 
                    class who lives in our unit and is scheduled to release soon. Juan has been taking the lockdown as an opportunity to 
                    help him put together a plan for release and to coach him up on life choices. He came into the cell the other day and 
                    said "man, we need to get EARN running, this kid would be a perfect candidate." Juan has a really great way of 
                    reaching out and finding diamonds in the rough. And they really respond to him. If there is one thing this experience 
                    of living down here with a bunch of short timers (there are people releasing virtually every week), has done, it is 
                    to show us how critical of a need there is for the services we plan to offer. I really believe the public would be 
                    appalled if they knew how little is provided for prisoners returning to society. I have been spending my time working 
                    on some articles, reconnecting with our friend Art and working on putting together a 6 year plan (more on that below).
                    In looking back over the past several newsletters it occurred to us that there may be some people reading this that 
                    haven't heard the full EARN vision so we wanted take this issue to reiterate what EARN is all about. For those who 
                    have heard the elevator speech, hopefully you can share this with someone who hasn't.

                    <h3 class="points-each">Point of Perserverance:</h3>
                    <p id="perserverance">
                        Our friend Art just got out of prison after 34 years of incarceration. I met Art over 15 years ago and we 
                        were both serving Life Without the Possibility of Parole (LWOP) sentences. Today he is out and I have under 
                        4 years to go. While incarcerated Art was able to acquire Singing Heart Ranch, an amazing 100 year old 
                        homestead surrounded by the pristine woodlands of the Kaniksu National Forest and we were able to get EARN 
                        established as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and secure a 25 acre piece of land in the middle of the 
                        Olympic National Forest. We are now working together to develop a partnership between EARN and Singing Heart 
                        Ranch. Seems like a pretty cool story of perserverance.
                    </p> 
                    <h3 class="points-each">Point of Practice:</h3>
                    <p id="practice">
                        Working together with Art to develop a business plan and create a partnership between Singing Heart Ranch 
                        and EARN is exactly what our vision is. We hope to eventually have an extensive network of partner 
                        organizations that work together for common goals and the possibility of having our first partnership up 
                        and running before we even get out of prison is exciting. We have also been working on our 6 year plan 
                        and sending it out to Dev and Kev to discuss.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="points-each">Point of Peace:</h3>
                    <p id="peace">
                        Art has been sending Juan and I pictures of Singing Heart Ranch and it is a really special place. It was 
                        homesteaded in 1920 by a 15 year old foster girl named Vera Gevrez. Vera was raised in the Washington 
                        State foster care system from the age of 6 when her father handed her over to the state. Vera married 
                        a horse breeder and they bred Percheron horses at the Ranch. Art has a vision for operating the ranch 
                        in dedication to Vera's memory and offer services to mitigate the harm caused by the state's foster care 
                        and carceral institutions.

                        <h2 class="body-header">THE PLANET</h2>
                        <P class="body-text">
                            As I am sure you know, there are massive problems facing the planet. There are also huge obstacles 
                            for people releasing from prison. EARN hopes to address these two issues with a unique holistic 
                            approach to reintegration. Essentially, we recognize that many prisoners have the very qualities that 
                            make them especially suited to be business owners and environmental solutions architects. We also 
                            recognize that formerly incarcerated people have experienced tremendous trauma, have lost key 
                            wage-earning years, have little chance of home ownership or a retirement plan and can easily fall 
                            into the trap of working at a job that merely pays the bills and doesn't allow for the opportunity 
                            to get ahead. We are in the process of building a network that takes a holistic approach to coming out 
                            of prison in several key ways. By making a significant investment in people when they first come out, 
                            we can not only avoid the pain and expense of reincarceration, we can set people up for successful 
                            business ownership. At the same time we can create businesses that address solutions to some of the 
                            challenges facing our planet.
                        </P>

                        <p class="body-text">
                            Environmental Advancement Reintegration Network is a sustainable business incubator and accelerator, 
                            dedicated to creating launching platforms for formerly incarcerated people to excel in professional 
                            endeavors that target environmental solutions, while simultaneously providing a community of health 
                            and wholeness. The organization was envisioned and created by five incarcerated people who met while 
                            serving long-term sentences in a Washington state prison. We have experienced firsthand the unique and 
                            rare skills inside of prison that can be harnessed to accomplish significant environmental outcomes. 
                            We have confidence that by addressing key obstacles and needs of people exiting prison, in an 
                            environment of wellness, shared resources, and community. We can accelerate the ability to become 
                            prosperous , healthy, effective and impactful.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-text">
                            The plan is to develop a system where people coming out of prison will have a place to live for 18 
                            months in a therapeutic community that provides an opportunity to build a business in environmental 
                            fields, pathways toward home ownership and a sustainable lifestyle, pathways towards land ownership 
                            and partnership in a supportive network of other formerly incarcerated business owners and advocates.
                            The goal is that during the 18 months the participant will have greatly increased their ability to 
                            thrive and make a positive influence on society and the planet. We intend to build several features 
                            to support those goals:

                        <p class="body-text">
                            We understand it is essential to have opportunities to unplug and "wash off" some of the residue of 
                            prison. We know the power of spending time in nature and have built into our model a commitment to 
                            provide that time and space. We currently have a license agreement to conduct forest therapy retreats 
                            on a 25 acre piece of pristine forest on the Olympic Peninsula we call the Refuge and we are working 
                            on other partnerships to provide retreats and forest therapy.

                            The Farm is an Intentional Sustainable Community where participants can live while learning and 
                            practicing sustainable life skills, develop agricultural business models and manage fully functioning 
                            aspects of the farm. This will be a working farm with a vermiculture/black soldier operation, 
                            greenhouses, gardens and livestock areas. The Farm will be fueled by a robust Community Supportive 
                            Agriculture (CSA) membership. We are currently looking for the right piece of land on the Olympic 
                            Peninsula for this effort.

                            The Bridge will be a facility where participants can build their businesses. Our goal is to find a 
                            building that can have several bays set up to allow participants access to get their business off 
                            the ground. We will have common workshops stocked with tools so that individuals can build out the 
                            needed materials for their business and common office space with computers, high speed internet where 
                            participants can do paperwork and research. We will also have mentorship services, assistance with 
                            grant writing, support groups and common rec and meeting areas.

                            We understand that we are suggesting a radical approach to reintegration. That is what is needed and 
                            we believe we have the vision and skill set to make it happen. Much of the current model is based on 
                            the idea of avoiding the cost and pain of recidivism, with pretty dismal results, our model is based 
                            on the idea of making a significant investment in individuals so that they can thrive and have a large 
                            positive impact for the rest of their lives.

                    <p class="thoughts">
                        We are quickly reaching a point where we are ready to start raising funds and writing grants to turn EARN 
                        from a vision into a reality. Kev and Dev, two of the five founders, are out and doing great, and Juan 
                        and I are relatively close to being out (4 and 5 years). With the possibility of a partnership with 
                        Singing Heart Ranch we are close to the point of being able to launch a fundraising campaign, purchase 
                        additional land and start building infrastructure. We have a big vision and it is going to take time and 
                        significant resources to build, so the opportunity to get started soon is awesome. We especially want to 
                        thank our amazing community of supporters. Even though we have been seperated, knowing that you are reading 
                        these newsletters and believe in us has really kept us going through these difficult two years of Covid. We 
                        look forward to sharing with you our plans in the coming months, (we have a lot to share.) As always, if you 
                        can think of someone who should be getting this newsletter please let Kev know. Thank you so much for being in 
                        our corner!
