                        The Refuge will be a place of solace where participants can have retreats, take time to unwind, and 
                        experience the healing qualities of nature.

                        EARN has a licensing agreement with Jefferson Land Trust on approximately 25 acres of forest along the 
                        Duckabush River on the Olympic Peninsula. The land is part of a permanent conservation project and 
                        contains a grove of old growth forest, pristine riverfront, and is home to a wide range of wildlife. 
                        EARN has an exclusive license agreement for use of the land for forest retreats, meditation, and recreational 
                        use.

                        People coming out of long-term incarceration face a wide range of challenges. Forest therapy, also known 
                        as Forest Bathing (from the Japanese "Shinrin-Yoku")*, helps us remember our place in a kin-centric network 
                        of relationships with all beings. Because it creates strong bonds between people and natural environments, 
                        forest bathing is an important foundation for ecological awareness and activism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Forest therapy has been successfully used with soldiers struggling with PTSD and studies have shown that the 
                        majority of people who have experienced long-term incarceration have some form of PTSD. Many prisoners become 
                        institutionalized over decades of incarceration. We become normalized to an unnatural environment. Time spent 
                        immersed in nature provides an opportunity to reverse some of the impacts of long-term incarceration.

                        Whether it be formalized therapy, retreats, or a simple fishing trip, The Refuge will be central to the 
                        healing environment of the overall project and will also be made available to other partners in the 
                        collaboration for forest therapy and retreat work.

                    *<strong>Shinrin-Yoku</strong> (SY) is a traditional Japanese practice of immersing oneself in nature by 
                    mindfully using all five senses. During the 1980's, SY surfaced in Japan as a pivotal part of preventative 
                    health care and healing in Japanese medicine. The reported research findings associated with the healing 
                    components of SY specifically hones in on the therapeutic effects on: (1) the immune system function 
                    (increase in natural killer cells/cancer prevention); (2) cardiovascular system (hypertension.coronary artery 
                    disease); (3) the respiratory system (allergies and respiratory disease); (4) depression and anxiety (mood 
                    disorders and stress); (5) mental relaxation (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and; (6) human 
                    feelings of "awe" (increase in gratitude and selflessness).
